# evolution

## what

python simulations based on the later chapters in Stuart Kauffman's 1995 book *At Home in the Universe*
-   nk models for:
    -   rugged fitness landscapes
    -   correlated fitness landscapes
    -   coevolution
        -   1v1 basic
        -   n player basic
        -   assymetric: 1v1 but can control n, k, c, and how many mutations are considered for adaptation
-   images of graphs generated by the scripts

## why

for a module in a computational biology class

## how

most of the logic except for `coevolution/n.py` and `coevolution/asymmetric.py` was written from scratch
`coevolution/n.py` and `coevolution/asymmetric.py` and most of the plotting/graphing was generated by claude sonnet

## todo

fix the fact that in `correlated_landscape.py`, and in `coevolution` the nk models can take inputs from themselves
