# evolution

## what

python simulations based on the later chapters in Stuart Kauffman's 1995 book *At Home in the Universe*
-   nk models for:
    -   rugged fitness landscapes
    -   correlated fitness landscapes
    -   coevolution

## why

for a computational biology class

## how

the first two are mostly written from scratch (with the exception of the plot_peak_neightbors functions)
the `coevolution_2.py` is written from scratch
the `coevolution_n.py` is generated by claude sonnet

just download python and run them (probably need packages like matplotlib and np)
