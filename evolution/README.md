# evolution

## what

python simulations based on the later chapters in Stuart Kauffman's 1995 book *At Home in the Universe*
-   nk models for:
    -   rugged fitness landscapes
    -   correlated fitness landscapes
    -   coevolution

## why

for a computational biology class

## how

most of the logic except for `coevolution_n.py` was written from scratch
`coevolution_n.py` and most of the plotting was generated by claude sonnet

## todo

fix the fact that in correlated_landscape.py, coevolution_2.py, coevolution_n.py the nk models can take inputs from themselves
